## Introduction

The client for this project is a large retailer based in the United States. The company has identified issues in its warehouse operations, leading to losses and stock-outs for several products. The objective is to implement a forecasting model using artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the appropriate stock levels for at least the next 8 days. This initiative aims to enhance operational efficiency and increase the company’s profitability.

## Objectives

The primary objective is to develop a forecasting model utilizing a set of machine learning algorithms to predict sales for the next 8 days at the store-product level. These algorithms are trained using the extensive three-year history available in the retail company’s SQL database, employing massive modeling techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Project results

### Recommended actions from EDA

Several insights have been uncovered through the exploratory data analysis. The main actionable initiatives are summarized below.

1. With the current information collected by the company, it is challenging to determine whether intermittent demand is due to stock-outs or simply zero demand for the product. Therefore, it is highly recommended to track warehouse data closely.

2. To optimize sales and reduce warehouse costs, implementing a forecasting model based on machine learning algorithms can be highly effective. A bottom-up approach, starting at the product level, is particularly recommended in this context.

3. Discounts have proven to be quite successful, especially for product 090, which is the top seller. It may be worthwhile to apply this strategy to other products and evaluate the overall impact.

4. Saturdays and Sundays show the highest sales volumes, presenting an opportunity to develop targeted strategies and campaigns.

5. Special days like Thanksgiving, Labor Day, and Easter generate significant sales. These occasions should be thoroughly analyzed, and marketing strategies should be developed to enhance the company’s profitability.


### Sales forecasting model

In this project, we have developed a robust recursive forecasting model based on a set of machine learning algorithms for sales prediction. This model analyzes each product-store combination individually and tailors the algorithm to predict demand for the next 8 days. LightGBM, with standard hyperparameters, was identified as the best option for predictive performance. The model was tested with new data from December 2015, yielding satisfactory results, with a mean absolute error of approximately 4.73.

This forecasting model will help to reduce warehouse costs and stock-outs, significantly boosting the company's performance and profitability.

## Instructions

The project should be run using the same environment in which it was created.

* Project environment can be replicated using the <mark>retail.yml</mark> file, which was created during the set up phase of the project. It can be found in the folder <mark>01_Documentos</mark>.
* To replicate the environment it is necessary to copy the <mark>retail.yml</mark> file to the directory and use the terminal or anaconda prompt executing:
  * conda env create --file retail.yml --name project_name

On the other hand, remember to update the project_path variable of the notebooks to the path where you have replicated the project.
